                    management processes.</p>

                <h3>Seven phases of our Product Management practice:</h3>
                <p><b>Idea:</b> In this phase, new suggestions, ideas and feature requests are captured and analysed.
                    It's important that every idea is captured in an organized manner from the very start. Our strategy
                    is to avoid innovation erosion when moving from design to prototype to production to market.</p>
                <p><b>Specifications: </b> As a part of this phase, ideas and feature requests are detailed out, in
                    order to better understand the business benefits, impact, estimated cost and high level risks.</p>
                <p><b>Roadmap:</b> In this phase, entire product strategy and vision is taken into account, and focus is
                    put on the initiatives that line up with the big vision of the product. A roadmap is a communication
                    tool that helps communicate where you are, where you are heading and how you expect to get there.
                </p>
                <p><b>Prioritization:</b> In this phase, a more detailed analysis is done, with the goal of setting
                    priorities based on a various inputs.</p>
                <p><b>Delivery:</b> As a part of Delivery phase, the product manager works closely with the technology,
                    marketing, support, and other teams to make sure features are delivered to a high quality and as per
                    specifications.</p>
                <p><b>Trials: </b>In this phase, experiments are run and analytics are tracked in order to continually
                    test and improve the product.</p>
                <p><b>Continuous Improvement: </b>Throughout the cycle, customer feedback plays a key role in validating
                    and improving on proposed features and products. It offers direct insight and suggestions that help
                    you to understand how you are doing to solve issues you're trying to address, and to discover new
                    issues you weren't aware of.</p>
